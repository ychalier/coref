# coref
A symbolic approach to co-reference resolution.

## content

See the [report](report.pdf) or the [slides](slides.pdf) for a detailed problem exposition.

Currently, the solver is in [parser.py](parser.py). For now, it does not read user input, so you want to edit the file to change the lines to parse. To debug, set the parameter `verbose` of `parse_aux` to `True`.
